# Ohm Value Calculator - React Frontend - Showcase Project

Project Requirements
- The electronic color code (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_color_code) is used to indicate the values or ratings of electronic components, very commonly for resistors.
- Create a React JS web interface that will allow someone to call an ASP.NET backend to calculate the resistance.
- Write the unit tests you feel are necessary to adequately test the code.

## Working Demo
- https://ohm-value-calculator.firebaseapp.com

## Version
0.0.1

## Tech
* [React] - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [Redux] - A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
* [Redux Thunk] - Thunk middleware for Redux.
* [Material UI] - React components that implement Google's Material Design.

## Running locally
- Follow the instructions at (https://github.com/shahmirn/OhmValueCalculatorDotNetCore/blob/master/README.md) to run the backend.
- git clone https://github.com/shahmirn/ohm-value-calculator-react.git
- cd ohm-value-calculator-react
- npm install
- npm run start
- Go to http://localhost:3000/

## Running tests
